<p>Haskell is a lazy language. This means that it will never do the work, if no one wants the result of it.</p>
<h2 id="lets-start-with-c">Let’s start with C++</h2>
<p>Assume we want a list of some number of the same IP addresses. We will hardly want that in real life, but this example shows the essence of lazy evaluations really well.</p>
<p>The function in C++, which returns the list of addresses, can look like this:</p>
<p>```c++ typedef std::vector<std::string> IPAddresses;</p>
<p>IPAddresses generate_addresses(size_t howMany, const std::string&amp; address) { const IPAddresses addresses(howMany, address); return addresses; } ```</p>
<p>Now we need a function, which receives a given number of addresses from this list and prints them on the screen. For example:</p>
<p>```c++ void take_and_print(size_t howMany, const IPAddresses&amp; addresses) { for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; howMany; ++i) { std::cout &lt;&lt; addresses[i] &lt;&lt; std::endl; } }</p>
<p>int main() { take_and_print(2, generate_addresses(100, “127.0.0.1”)); } ```</p>
<p>The function <code>take_and_print</code> receives a list, generated by the function <code>generate_addresses</code>, and then prints the first two addresses from this list.</p>
<p>The output will be:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">127.0.0.1</span>
<span class="kw">127.0.0.1</span></code></pre>
<p>Everything would be fine, but we only needed two strings out of 100 generated. The remaining 98 strings were generated for nothing. Time was taken, memory was taken - all for nothing.</p>
<p>This is the consequence of the eager evaluations in C++. The function <code>generate_addresses</code> is straightforward. It was told to generate 100 addresses and it generated 100 addresses. If you’ll tell to generate a million - you’ll get a million. Tell it to generate a billion - OK, a little bit of patience, but you’ll get a billion.</p>
<p>At the same time the function <code>take_and_print</code> is also straightforward and it doesn’t care for the efforts of <code>generate_addresses</code>. If it was told to display just the first two elements, it’ll do just that. And it doesn’t care, how many of them are left, ten or half a billion.</p>
<p>The result of eager evaluations is extra work. But functions in Haskell, unlike their hardworking colleagues in C++, hate extra work.</p>
<h2 id="thats-how-it-is-in-haskell">That’s how it is in Haskell</h2>
<p>Open the file <code>Main.hs</code> and rewrite it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">main <span class="fu">=</span> print (take <span class="dv">2</span> (replicate <span class="dv">100</span> <span class="st">&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;</span>))</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>replicate</code> creates a list of 100 “127.0.0.1” addresses, and the function <code>take</code> takes the first 2 addresses from this list (hence the number 2 passed to it as the first argument). The function <code>print</code> converts it to string and outputs it. Do not mind the syntactical obscurities of this code. They will be explained in full details in the following chapters.</p>
<p>The trick is that the function <code>replicate</code> generates a list of 2 addresses, not 100. Why? Because that is the number necessary for the function <code>take</code>.</p>
<p>The function <code>replicate</code> is lazy. Despite of the fact, that we asked to create a list of 100 strings, it looks around and thinks: “Hmm, who needs my strings? Aha, the function <code>take</code> needs them. How much does it need? Alright, just two. Then why do I need to create a hundred, if it needs only two?! Here are your two strings, be happy!”</p>
<p>Yes, hard work is good and laziness is bad, but in this case I like the lazy function more. It, like a good innovator, does not as much, as it was asked, but as much as it is really necessary. This is the essence of lazy evaluations in Haskell.</p>
<p>Of course, if the appetite of the function <code>take</code> increases and it will ask for the first fifty elements instead of the first two, then the function <code>replicate</code> will create a list of 50 strings. Just as much as neccesary, not a bit more.</p>
<p>But how can we know, that the function <code>replicate</code> creates only as much IP addresses as necessary? What if it is not true? Let’s check.</p>
<p>Haskell laziness allows us to operate on infinitely large lists. No, not simply very large, but really infinite. Let’s rewrite our example:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">main <span class="fu">=</span> print (take <span class="dv">2</span> (repeat <span class="st">&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;</span>))</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>repeat</code> creates an infinitely large list of IP addresses, every element of which will be the passed address <code>127.0.0.1</code>. If our hardworking function <code>generate_addresses</code> from C++ wanted to become just like its lazy colleague, it will need to become something like:</p>
<p><code>c++ IPAddresses generate_addresses(const std::string&amp; address) { 	IPAddresses addresses; 	for (;;) { 		addresses.push_back(address); 	} 	return addresses; }</code></p>
<p>And this function hangs. The cause of it is the eager nature of the function <code>generate_addresses</code>. It was told to generate an infinitely large list - and it will do so until the last breath, because the <code>for</code> loop has no end.</p>
<p>But if we build our Haskell project and launch it, then there will be no hangs, and two familiar addresses will be printed on the screen.</p>
<p>That’s because the function <code>repeat</code> is as lazy and rational, as it <code>replicate</code> colleague. Sure, we asked it to generate an infinitely large list, but it will generate the list as big as it is necessary. And if in this case only two strings are necessary - fine, here’s your list of two strings. And if you need a list of million strings - you’ll get a million.</p>
<p>So the essence of lazy evaluations in Haskell is: it doesn’t matter how much you are told to do, because in the end you’ll do as much as it is in fact necessary.</p>
