Gratitudes
----------

This book is not a result of my efforts only. I thank all developers who helped me to understand and to love Haskell. And despite the fact that some of these people are not even aware that they helped me, I still appreciate them.

All non-English names are in original form.

I thank the authors of ["Real World Haskell"](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/), Bryan O'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen. Yes, this book is a little obsolete, but this book helped me to understand that Haskell is suitable not only for the implementation of quicksort algorithm.

I thank Miran Lipovača, the author of ["Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!"](http://learnyouahaskell.com/). This funny book with an elephant at a cover assured me that I can understand Haskell even I haven't academic degree in mathematics.

I thank the authors of Russian books about Haskell. Антон Холомьёв и Роман Душкин, спасибо вам!

And I'm very grateful to developers from different IT-communities who gave me many valuable comments and suggestions for this book. I'd like to personally thank these developers: Артёма Петрова, Верната Хисамова, Артёма Казака, Анатолия Архипова, Евгения Бахвалова, Павла Климова, Ивана Ремизова, Павла Зайцева, Алексея Салина, Максима Харина, Филиппа Ковалёва, Ивана Голикова. Also I thank all developers who donated for this book. Thank you all!

And finally I'd like to thank you, my reader. Thank you for time you spent to read this book, and thank you for your attention to me, to an ordinary programmer. 

Good luck!
